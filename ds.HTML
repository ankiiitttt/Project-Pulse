 <div class="project" id="project1">
    <h2>Project 1: Implementing a Linked List</h2>
    <p>A linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node. Implementing a linked list involves creating nodes, adding, deleting, and traversing the list.</p>
</div>


<div class="project" id="project2">
    <h2>Project 2: Building a Stack</h2>
    <p>A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. This project involves implementing stack operations like push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty.</p>
</div>

<div class="project" id="project3">
    <h2>Project 3: Queue Simulation</h2>
     <P>A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. The project involves implementing queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, front, and rear.</p>
</div>

<div class="project" id="project4">
    <h2>Project 4: Binary Search Tree</h2>
    <p>A binary search tree (BST) is a node-based data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left and right child. This project involves inserting, deleting, and searching for elements in a BST.</p>
</div>

<div class="project" id="project5">
    <h2>Project 5: Graph Representation</h2>
    <p>Graphs are used to represent networks. This project involves representing a graph using adjacency lists and matrices and implementing basic graph algorithms like BFS and DFS.</p>
</div>

<div class="project" id="project6">
    <h2>Project 6: Hash Table Implementation</h2>
    <p>A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. This project involves implementing hash functions and handling collisions using techniques like chaining or open addressing.</p>
</div>

<div class="project" id="project7">
    <h2>Project 7: Priority Queue using Heap</h2>
    <p>A priority queue is an abstract data type where each element has a priority. The project involves implementing a priority queue using a heap, which allows for efficient extraction of the highest (or lowest) priority element.</p>
</div>

<div class="project" id="project8">
    <h2>Project 8: Trie for Dictionary</h2>
    <p>A trie is a special type of tree used to store associative data structures. In this project, you will implement a trie for efficiently storing and searching a large dictionary of words.</p>
</div>

<div class="project" id="project9">
    <h2>Project 9: AVL Tree</h2>
    <p>An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. Implementing an AVL tree involves insertion, deletion, and rotation operations to maintain balance.</p>
</div>

<div class="project" id="project10">
    <h2>Project 10: Circular Queue</h2>
    <p>A circular queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle, but the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. This project involves implementing circular queue operations.</p>

    <h2>A circular queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle, but the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. This project involves implementing circular queue operations.</h2>
    <p>A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where each node contains an extra bit for denoting the color of the node, either red or black. This project involves implementing insertion and deletion operations while maintaining the tree's balance.</p>
</div>

<div class="project" id="project12">
    <h2>Project 12: Dijkstra's Algorithm</h2>
    <p>Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. This project involves implementing Dijkstra's algorithm using a priority queue.</p>

    <h2>Project 13: Huffman Coding</h2>
    <p>Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The project involves implementing Huffman encoding and decoding using a binary tree.</p>
</div>

<div class="project" id="project14">
    <h2>Project 14: LRU Cache Implementation</h2>
    <p>An LRU (Least Recently Used) cache discards the least recently used items first. This project involves implementing an LRU cache using a combination of a doubly linked list and a hash map.</p>
</div>

<div class="project" id="project15">
    <h2>Project 15: Sparse Matrix</h2>
    <p>A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. This project involves implementing storage and operations on sparse matrices efficiently using data structures like linked lists.</p>

    <h2>Project 16: Balanced Parentheses Checker</h2>
    <p>This project involves implementing a stack-based solution to check whether a string of parentheses is balanced. It's a common problem in compilers and expression evaluators.</p>
</div>

<div class="project" id="project17">
    <h2>Project 17: Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)</h2>
    <p>The Union-Find data structure keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. This project involves implementing union-find operations with path compression and union by rank.</p>
